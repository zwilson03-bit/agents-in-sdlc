# Copilot Workshops — Workshop Authoring Guide

This repo hosts the **workshop content** for **Copilot Workshops**, published as an Astro + Starlight site at <https://github-samples.github.io/copilot-workshops/>. The demo application learners build during the workshop lives in a separate repository: <https://github.com/github-samples/tailspin-toys>.

**This is a content-only repo.** Do not add the demo app's application code (Astro SSR endpoints, the Drizzle data layer, UI components, Tailwind styles, or tests) here. Application changes belong in `tailspin-toys`.

## Repository structure

- `docs/` — **Source Markdown for all lessons. Edit here.** Browsable directly on github.com; no build required.
  - `README.md` — Workshop landing page (also the site home via `slug: index` frontmatter).
  - `cli/`, `vscode/`, `cloud/`, `app/` — Per-harness lessons (Copilot CLI / VS Code / Cloud agent / GitHub Copilot app). Each folder's landing page is a `README.md` (routed via a `slug:` matching the folder path). Each harness opens with its own `0-prerequisites.md` setup lesson; the CLI and VS Code harnesses set up a codespace, while the app and cloud harnesses cover the setup their flow needs (for the app, installing Node.js locally and creating the project from the template).
  - `es-es/`, `ja-jp/`, `ko-kr/`, `pt-br/`, `zh-cn/` — Localized content at the locale-root paths required by Starlight. Translated pages mirror the English path beneath each locale directory; untranslated pages use Starlight's English fallback.
  - `_images/` — Screenshots and diagrams (shared across all locales).
- `website/` — Optional Astro + Starlight site that publishes `docs/` to GitHub Pages (loader `base: '../docs'`). Only needed to self-host or preview the rendered site.
  - `astro.config.mjs` — Site config including the manually maintained sidebar and the `locales` block. The legacy `/shared/0-prereqs/` → home (`/`) redirect is a full-HTML redirect page at `src/pages/shared/0-prereqs.astro` (not an `astro.config.mjs` `redirects` entry, which would emit a stub with no `<html>` element that Pagefind can't index). Prerequisites are now per-harness (`/<harness>/0-prerequisites/`), so the old shared-prereqs URL forwards to the home page.
  - `src/content.config.ts` — Custom content loader (`base: '../docs'`) that excludes underscore-prefixed support directories so `_images/` is not routed as content.
- `AUTHORING.md` — Author entry point (recipes for adding lessons and images).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Short pointer to AUTHORING.md + PR/CI rules.
- `.github/`
  - `copilot-instructions.md` — This file.
  - `instructions/` — Scoped instruction files (`applyTo` frontmatter targets specific file globs).
  - `agents/` — Custom agents available to Copilot.
  - `skills/` — Skills available to Copilot (see [`skills/README.md`](skills/README.md) for the index of what each one does).
  - `workflows/pages.yml` — Builds and deploys the site.
  - `workflows/content-alignment.md` — Agentic workflow that checks PRs for duplicated content needing aligned updates.

## Authoring conventions

### Reusing prose across paths

When the same prose applies to multiple harnesses (CLI, VS Code, cloud), copy it inline into each per-harness `.md` lesson. There is no import-based shared content system; the host page owns frontmatter, headings, navigation, and body prose.

Because inline copies can drift, run the `check-content-alignment` skill after editing duplicated sections. The `.github/workflows/content-alignment.md` agentic workflow performs the same analysis on PRs as a safety net, but do not rely on it as a substitute for updating all affected lessons.

### Admonitions

- **Use GitHub admonition syntax everywhere** — published lessons *and* repository Markdown. Put the `[!NOTE]` / `[!TIP]` / `[!IMPORTANT]` / `[!WARNING]` / `[!CAUTION]` marker on its own `>`-prefixed line, with the body on subsequent `>`-prefixed lines.
- In published lessons under `docs/**`, the `remark-github-admonitions-to-directives` plugin (wired in `website/astro.config.mjs`) converts these to Starlight asides at build time (NOTE/IMPORTANT to note, TIP to tip, WARNING/CAUTION to caution). Do **not** author Starlight `:::` directives.
- GitHub syntax has no custom-title or nesting form: put a callout heading on a **bold lead-in line** (`> **Title**`, then a blank `>` line, then the body), and emit "nested" callouts as sibling blockquotes separated by a blank line. Full mapping and patterns live in [`.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`](instructions/markdown.instructions.md).

### Linking

- **Inside the workshop:** Markdown ref-style links (`[Exercise 1][exercise-1]` with `[exercise-1]: ../1-foo/` defined at the bottom).
- **External docs:** Full URLs to `docs.github.com` and other authoritative sources.
- **Cross-repo (template repo, sample code):** Full URLs to `github.com/github-samples/tailspin-toys/...`. Do **not** link to files inside *this* repo as if they were the template — `tailspin-toys` is the learner template.

## Building, previewing, and verifying

The tooling for building, previewing, and verifying the site lives in the [`build-and-verify-docs`](skills/build-and-verify-docs/SKILL.md) skill. Run that verification sequence before every commit, and don't commit if any step fails. Derive expected pages from the current content and configuration rather than fixed totals.

Before opening or updating a PR, also make the **PR-time consistency pass** documented in that skill — a structural-drift sweep (renamed paths, stale skill/instruction references, CI claims, repository-structure trees, and copied prose alignment) that the build and link check can't catch.

## Commit hygiene

- Conventional commit prefixes preferred (`docs:`, `chore:`, `fix:`).
- Always include the trailer:

## Things NOT to do here

- Don't add the demo app's application code — Astro SSR endpoints, the Drizzle data layer, `.astro` UI components, Tailwind classes, or Vitest/Playwright tests. That belongs in `github-samples/tailspin-toys`.
- Don't author against application source paths — the demo app is a single Astro project that lives in `tailspin-toys`, not here.
- Don't generate summary markdown files at the end of a task.
- Don't add `mkdocs.yml` or other parallel docs tooling — Astro + Starlight is the site.
