**[GitHub Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-chat)** in VS Code brings GitHub Copilot into the code editor you already use. Working in Visual Studio Code (and GitHub Codespaces), you'll drive Copilot Chat in agent mode, connect external tools through MCP, and rely on custom agents — all without leaving your IDE, where Copilot has full view of your files, terminal, and problems.

You'll start by adding custom instructions and watching Copilot follow them, then use agent mode to build a filtering feature across the UI, data layer, and tests. Next you'll connect the Playwright MCP server and let Copilot drive a browser to test your feature before opening a pull request. Finally, you'll review and use a custom agent for accessibility work, then monitor, steer, and iterate on Copilot's changes — all without leaving the editor.
