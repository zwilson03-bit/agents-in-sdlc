**[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli)** puts GitHub Copilot in your terminal as an agentic coding assistant. It explores codebases, generates code, runs commands, and connects to external tools — all from the command line, so you can stay in the flow without switching to a graphical editor.

Across these exercises you'll install and authenticate Copilot CLI, then give it project context with custom instructions before using plan mode to generate a feature deliberately. You'll connect the Playwright MCP server to test that feature in a real browser, then extend Copilot with reusable agent skills and custom agents. Finally, you'll explore slash commands for managing context, models, and sharing, and wrap up with a review of what you've built. An optional three-module series uses GitHub Copilot CLI and Foundry to prepare a model, build and deploy a hosted agent, and connect it to the website.

## Prerequisites

Before attending this workshop, please ensure you have:

- [ ] A GitHub account with an active **Copilot Student, Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise** plan
- [ ] Basic familiarity with terminal/command line operations
- [ ] Git installed and configured

> [!TIP]
> No paid plan? Verified students can get GitHub Copilot for free through [GitHub Education][callout-student-plan-education]. The **Copilot Student** plan includes the agent, MCP, code review, and Copilot CLI features this workshop uses — so you can complete every harness with it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise, ensure your admin has enabled Copilot CLI for use.
